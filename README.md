# IPv8.net - ![Build status.](https://travis-ci.org/jonathanjuursema/ipv8.net.svg?branch=master)

[IPv8.net](https://www.ipv8.net) is a small project that does nothing more than display some information on your current internet connection.

It is mainly there as a project for me to play around with AWS and CI/CD. But if you ever need to know your IP or ISP, feel free to check out the site.
